## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14)
- Python (>=3.10)
- npm or yarn
- pip
- Self-hosted [Consumet API](https://github.com/consumet/api.consumet.org)

---

### 📦 Backend Setup

Before running the backend, you need to create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following keys:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:<your_port>
ROOT_URL=http://localhost:<your_port>
MANGAPI_URL=<address_of_your_self_hosted_consumet_api>
```

> Ensure that VITE_API_URL and ROOT_URL have the same port

Then run:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/manga-downloader.git
cd manga-downloader/server

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload --port <your_port>
```

### 🎨 Frontend Setup

Before running the frontend, you also need to create a `.env` file in the `client` directory with the same keys:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:<your_port>
ROOT_URL=http://localhost:<your_port>
MANGAPI_URL=<address_of_your_self_hosted_consumet_api>
```

> Ensure that VITE_API_URL and ROOT_URL have the same port

Then run:

```bash
cd ../client  # or wherever your React code lives

# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
